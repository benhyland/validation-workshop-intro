					<h2>What is functional programming?</h2>
					<p>
						As a definition:
						<ul>
							<li>programming with functions</li>
							<li>programming without <em>side effects</em></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>What does this mean?</p>
				</section>
				<section style="text-align: left;">
					<h2>What is a function?</h2>
					<p>Maths-style definition: one input, one output</p>
					<p>Functions always give an output for any input ('total' vs 'partial')</p>
					<p>Inputs and outputs can be functions - if so, we call the function 'higher-order'</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>Side effects</h1>
						<p>
							when a function does anything other than computing a result:
							<ul>
								<li>Modifying a variable, field or data structure</li>
								<li>Throwing an exception</li>
								<li>Starting a new thread</li>
								<li>I/O: reading from or writing to the console, files, sockets etc</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section style="text-align: left;">
						<p>Effects are context-sensitive.</p>
						<p>Not all effects need to be controlled in every context.</p>
						<p>Other things which are also arguably effects are not commonly tracked - for example, allocating memory.</p>
						<p>Effects are <em>observable behavior</em> from some point of view determined by the runtime.</p>
						<p>In a runtime designed for some high-security algorithmics, time taken to execute might be an effect since it is observable via timing attacks.</p>
						<p>So, how do we get anything done? We encode our effects as values and pass them to the runtime so it can perform them for us.</p>
						<p>We end up with a pure-functional program wrapped up by an effect-performing runtime.</p>
					</section>

						<h2>Benefits</h2>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Easy to reason about</li>
								<li>Better modularisation</li>
								<li>Easier to test</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What does</h2>
						<h1>easy to reason about</h1>
						<h2>mean, then?</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left;">
							when functions do the same thing whenever they are called
							<ul>
								<li>Can't use or modify external variables (constants are OK)</li>
								<li>Can't have side effects</li>
								<li>Always produce the same output given the same input</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section style="text-align: left;">
						<h2>Referential Transparency</h2>
						<p>a property of expressions, not just functions</p>
						<p>
							an expression <em>e</em> is referentially transparent if, for any program,
							any occurances of <em>e</em> can be replaced with the evaluation value of <em>e</em>
							without changing the meaning of the program
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Substitution Model/Equational Reasoning</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>mentally substituting expressions for values to reduce to a simpler form</li>
							<li>thinking about code is like algebra</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 60%;">
							When expressions are RT, we can think about what our program does by calculating what values small
							expressions have and substituting the results into bigger expressions. We just repeat the process
							until we come up with the value we are interested in (called reduction).
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 60%;">
							This is analogous to solving an algebraic equation - you only need to look at the local stuff to solve a piece.
							Once a piece is solved, it stays solved and the knowledge gained can be applied elsewhere.
							In the FP world this property is called Equational Reasoning.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 60%;">
							Some people care less about the 'equational' and more that reasoning is 'local'
							- you don't need to scroll much or look at multiple files to understand what a function does
							- you just look at its args and body.
						</p>
					</section>

					<h2>Testing and modularisation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>input/output testing is less fiddly and brittle than mocks and stubs</li>
						<li>function composition produces new useful functions (especially with HOFs)</li>
						<li>not much distinction between functions and programs</li>
					</ul>
					<p>None of this works well in the presence of side effects.</p>
				</section>

					<h2>What does functional style code look like?</h2>
					<h3>(you're already doing lots of it)</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left">- Tends to be pretty short</p>
					<p style="text-align: left">- Expressions rather than statements</p>
					<p style="text-align: left">- Decompose problems into chains of functions</p>
					<p style="text-align: left">- Order of execution not important</p>
					<p style="text-align: left">- Immutable data</p>
					<p style="text-align: left">All are consequences of designing languages without side effects.</p>

					<h3>Haskell</h3>
					<pre><code data-trim class="language-haskell">
&gt; let rightTriangles = [(a, b, c) |
				c &lt;- [1..10], b &lt;- [1..c], a &lt;- [1..b],
				a^2 + b^2 == c^2,
				a + b + c == 24]
&gt; rightTriangles
&gt; [(6,8,10)]
					</code></pre>

					<pre><code data-trim class="language-java">
users
    .stream()
    .filter(u -&gt; shouldNotifyFor(u, message))
    .map(u -&gt; u.getEmailAddress())
    .forEach(email -&gt; deliver(message, email));

					<h3>Scala</h3>
					<pre><code data-trim class="language-scala">
val (nextState, outputMessages) = process(state, input)
for {
    m &lt;- outputMessages
    json = m.asJson
    c &lt;- nextState.outputChannelsFor(m)
} {
    c.emit(json)

					<h3>Ruby</h3>
					<pre><code data-trim class="language-ruby">
expiries = records.flat_map do |record|
  lookup_items(item_type, record).map do |item|
    [item.name, item.expiry, item.expiry_reason]
  end
end
expiries.select { |expiry| Date.parse(expiry[1]) &lt;= reference_date }
					</code></pre>

					<h2>Advantages and disadvantages</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>More modular, easily decomposeable and testable</li>
						<li>Need to debug (rather than test) less often</li>
						<li>Modelling system invariants can be easier</li>
						<li>Makes it easy to focus on correctness</li>
						<li>Avoids having to understand non-local state changes</li>
						<li>Higher level of asbtraction</li>
						<li>Smaller communities</li>
						<li>Time/space performance can be hard to predict in advance</li>
						<li>Time investment to learn</li>
						<li>Can be harder to debug</li>
						<li>Not well suited to problems with lots of external state changes</li>
					</ul>
